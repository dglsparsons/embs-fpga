\section{Problem Analysis} %100 words
For this open-assessment, the problem was to use an FPGA to solve an NP-hard 
problem: the travelling salesman problem. The solution must interact with a user 
via serial to receive a world size and world-id. It will then
request and download a world via ethernet, identify the shortest path around the 
waypoints in this world, avoiding any walls, and finally display and verify the solution. 
\par\bigskip\noindent
This problem can be divided into three main sections: interactions with VGA, ethernet
and the user; creation of a matrix containing distances between each pair of waypoints;
and determining the shortest distance in which every waypoint can be visited.

\section{Design} % 100 words
For the design of the solution, two hardware components were used: the Microblaze, 
which handles interactions with VGA, the user and ethernet, 
and a custom piece of hardware for solving the travelling salesman problem, and 
calculating shortest distances using the A* algorithm. The use of special purpose 
hardware allows many parts of the solution to be pipelined, or run in parallel. 
As a result, this provides a large increase in speed over a purely software approach 
for both the A*, and the travelling salesman problem. The remainder of the software 
was chosen to run on the MicroBlaze as it is not computationally expensive. 
While running this code on hardware could improve the speed, for example, by 
providing an entire VGA buffer at once, it is not the limiting factor for the 
given problem.

\section{Implementation} % 200 words
% Ethernet, VGA, Serial - use the MicroBlaze because these are not
% computationally expensive

% A*
% Storing 60 x 60 grid, 2 bits for state, 2 bits for direction of parent.

% Brute force 
% Uses quickperm algorithm in order to test each possible combination. 

\section{Acceleration Strategy} % 200 words
In order to speed up the solution, 3 improvements were made upon the original design. 
\par\bigskip\noindent
First, as the original A* algorithm was calculating the cost of each node by 
counting the number of parents until the start waypoint was reached, a significant 
speedup was attained by instead keeping track of the cost associated with each 
coordinate. This comes at the cost of increased memory usage, as each cost must 
be stored. As there are 3600 coordinates in a large grid, this is a significant 
amount of additional memory. 
\par\bigskip\noindent
Second, while performing the quickperm algorithm, redundant permutations were being 
generated. This occurs as distances between waypoints are the same in both directions: 
for example, path A--B--C has the same cost as path C--B--A. As a result, these 
duplicate results can be removed, significantly reducing the amount of permutations 
needed. This results in a significant reduction in work: rather than the original 
$11!$ permutations needed for a large world, there are therefore only $11!/2$. 
Furthermore, this improves the speed of the brute force approach for all sizes of 
world. This is implemented in practice by generating $10!$ permutations rather than
$11!$, and, for each permutation generated, creating $6$ variants by treating the 
first half of the array as having an extra element. 
\par\bigskip\noindent
Finally, the third improvement was made by considering the parallel capabilities 
of hardware. Unlike in software, it is possible to perform multiple operations at 
the same time. Therefore, in order to speed up the brute force process, 
two variations of the quickperm algorithm run in parallel for large worlds. 
As the size of the world is known, the array being 
permuted, \texttt{a}, and the permutation counting array, \texttt{p}, has a known 
mid-point that can be predetermined. By creating a second copy of the 
\texttt{brute\_force\_tsp} function, and ensuring the two share no data, the calls 
to both occur in parallel. This is verified by checking the analysis tab of 
vivado\_hls:  \\

This highlights two iterative permutation algorithms occurring in parallel.
